                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Early Life:</strong> Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a Persian scholar born around 780 CE in the region of Khwarazm (now part of Uzbekistan). He worked as a mathematician, astronomer, and geographer at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, a renowned center for learning and science during the Islamic Golden Age.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Al-Khwarizmi is often called the "father of algebra" for his book that introduced systematic methods for solving equations. However, his most crucial contribution to the concepts behind AI is the idea of the <strong>algorithm</strong>. The word itself is derived from his name. He developed detailed, step-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems, which is the foundational idea of any computer program or AI system: a clear set of rules to follow to achieve a specific outcome.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> Every piece of software, from a simple calculator to the most advanced neural network, runs on algorithms. Al-Khwarizmi's work established the concept that complex problems could be broken down into a finite sequence of simple, clear steps. This is the core principle that allows us to instruct computers and build the logic for modern AI to learn, reason, and make decisions.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Early Life:</strong> George Boole was born in Lincoln, England, to a family of modest means. Largely self-taught, he mastered mathematics and languages from a young age and became a schoolteacher to support his family. Despite his lack of formal university training, his genius was recognized, and he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Boole's masterpiece, "The Laws of Thought," introduced what is now known as <strong>Boolean algebra</strong>. This was his greatest contribution to mathematics and the future of AI. He proposed that logical statements could be expressed through algebraic equations, where variables could only have two values: true (1) or false (0). This system created a way to mathematically process logic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> Boolean algebra is the bedrock of all digital computing. Every computer chip contains millions or billions of tiny switches (transistors) that are either on (1) or off (0). All complex software and AI models are built upon these simple true/false operations. His work allows computers to make decisions, follow logical paths, and process information, which is the fundamental requirement for any form of artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Early Life:</strong> Arthur Samuel was born in Emporia, Kansas, and studied electrical engineering at MIT. He had a long and successful career at Bell Labs and later at IBM, where he did his most famous work in artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Samuel was a pioneer in computer gaming and AI. In 1959, he coined the term <strong>"machine learning."</strong> His greatest contribution was the Samuel Checkers-playing Program. This wasn't just a program that played checkers; it was one of the first programs that could learn from its own mistakes. It played thousands of games against itself to improve its strategy, eventually becoming better than Samuel himself.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> Samuel's program was a landmark demonstration of machine learning. The core idea—that a computer can improve its performance through experience without being explicitly programmed for every scenario—is the central concept of modern AI. Today's AI, from recommendation algorithms on Netflix to self-driving cars, all rely on this principle of learning from vast amounts of data to get better over time.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Early Life:</strong> Alan Turing was born in London, England, and showed signs of high intelligence from an early age. He studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge, where he conceived of his groundbreaking ideas on computation. During World War II, he was a leading codebreaker at Bletchley Park.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions:</strong> Outside of AI, his most famous contribution was cracking the German Enigma code during WWII, a feat that significantly shortened the war. His primary contribution to computer science was the concept of the <strong>"Turing machine,"</strong> a theoretical model of a general-purpose computer that could solve any problem that was computable.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Contributions to AI:</strong> Turing is widely considered the father of AI. He proposed the <strong>"Turing Test"</strong> in his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." The test was designed as a way to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. This question—"Can machines think?"—framed the entire field of artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> The Turing machine remains the theoretical foundation for all modern computers and programming. The Turing Test, while debated, continues to be a crucial benchmark in the philosophy of AI and has directly inspired the development of conversational AI and chatbots. His work laid the essential groundwork for thinking about machines not just as calculators, but as potential intellects.</p>

He was a true polymath whose work spanned political science, economics, psychology, and computer science. He won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 for his work on decision-making within organizations.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Simon's key contribution to AI was his theory of <strong>bounded rationality</strong>. He argued that humans don't make perfectly optimal choices but instead "satisfice"—they choose options that are "good enough" for their needs. Alongside Allen Newell, he co-created the Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver, applying these principles of decision-making to create computer programs that could "think."</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> Simon's concept of bounded rationality was revolutionary. It shifted the goal of some AI research from creating perfect, god-like intelligence to creating practical systems that can make effective decisions with limited time and information. This principle is crucial in modern AI, where systems often operate in complex, real-world environments and must find good solutions quickly rather than perfect ones slowly.</p>

He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II and later became a professor of computer science at MIT.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Weizenbaum is most famous for creating <strong>ELIZA</strong> in 1966, one of the world's first chatbots. ELIZA was programmed to simulate a psychotherapist by recognizing keywords in a user's text and rephrasing them as questions. He was shocked when people, including his own secretary, began to form emotional attachments to the simple program. This experience led him to become a prominent critic of artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> ELIZA was a landmark in natural language processing and human-computer interaction, demonstrating how easily machines could simulate conversation. However, Weizenbaum's more lasting influence is his ethical critique. His book, "Computer Power and Human Reason," warned against giving computers important responsibilities and questioned the wisdom of creating AI without considering the human consequences. His work inspires ongoing debates about the ethics and social impact of AI today.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> McCarthy is credited with formally defining the field of AI. In 1955, he organized the famous Dartmouth Workshop, for which he coined the term <strong>"Artificial Intelligence."</strong> This event brought together the founding fathers of AI and established it as a distinct academic discipline. He also invented the <strong>Lisp</strong> programming language, which became the language of choice for AI researchers for decades due to its flexibility in handling symbolic information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> McCarthy's act of naming and defining the field gave it a clear identity and a research agenda. His creation of Lisp influenced the development of many other programming languages and provided a powerful tool for early AI research. His focus on symbolic reasoning and logic laid the groundwork for expert systems and knowledge representation, which are still important areas of AI today.</p>

He attended Harvard and Princeton, where he built one of the first random-wiring neural network learning machines. In 1959, he co-founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory with John McCarthy, turning it into a world-leading center for AI research.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Minsky made foundational contributions to many areas of AI, including neural networks, robotics, and the theory of computation. He was interested in endowing machines with common sense and perception. His book <strong>"Perceptrons,"</strong> co-authored with Seymour Papert, analyzed the limitations of simple neural networks, which, while correct, had the unintended effect of slowing down research in the area for several years.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> Minsky's theories on how the human mind works, such as his "Society of Mind" theory, have inspired AI researchers to think about building complex systems from smaller, simpler agents. His work on knowledge representation and robotics helped shape the way we design intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world. He was a visionary who constantly pushed the boundaries of what machines could be made to do.</p>

For decades, he pursued research on neural networks, even when it was not a popular field.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Major Contributions & AI Contributions:</strong> Hinton is known as one of the "Godfathers of Deep Learning." His most critical contribution was his work in the 1980s on the <strong>backpropagation algorithm</strong>. This technique allowed neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to learn efficiently from their mistakes. It was the key that unlocked the potential of deep learning after years of slow progress.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Modern AI:</strong> Backpropagation is the engine that drives nearly all of modern AI. Every time you see image recognition on your phone, use a language translation service, or interact with a large language model like ChatGPT, you are using technology that relies on deep learning trained with backpropagation. Hinton's persistence and groundbreaking work are directly responsible for the current AI revolution.</p>
